% Use the following line _only_ if you're still using LaTeX 2.09.
%\documentstyle[icml2013,epsf,natbib]{article}
% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:
\documentclass{article}

% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern
% \usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{subcaption}
\usepackage{multicol}

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

% For math
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{siunitx}

% As of 2011, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the
% resulting PDF.  If this breaks your system, please commend out the
% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2013} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2013} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for
% submitting the draft version of the paper for review.  This will set

\usepackage{icml2013}
% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the

\section{Neural Networks}
In this section, we explore logistic regression with L1 and L2 regularization. We use gradient descent to compare the resulting weight vectors under different regularizers and regularization parameters, and we evaluate the effect of these choices in the context of multiple data sets.

\subsection{ReLU + Softmax}


\subsection{Initialization}
This is a reasonable choice because $m$ represents the number of neurons in each of our layers, which is what should control the variance of the distribution. The reason we do this is to ensure that the random input to a unit in a layer is agnostic to the number of inputs it receives.

\subsection{Regularization}
This would impact the pseudocode because now we must also incorporate this additional regularization term when taking the gradient of the loss function. Since this gradient is used in the stochastic gradient descent update it ultimately impacts the entire algorithm. 

\subsection{Binary classification}


\subsection{Multi-class classification}



\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
In this section, we explore various versions of the dual form of support vector machines, first with slack variables and then with generalized kernel functions.

\subsection{Convolutional filter receptive field}

\subsection{Run the Tensorflow conv net}

\subsection{Add pooling layers}

\subsection{Regularize your network!}

\subsection{Experiment with your architecture}

\subsection{Optimize your architecture}

\subsection{Test your final architecture on variations of the data}
